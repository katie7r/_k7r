    <p>I am a professional web developer whose enthusiasm and expertise span both front-end and back-end development, with a focus on making things that are easy and pleasant to use - for both users and developers. My interests outside of programming include playing video games (favorites include the Dragon Age series and Fire Emblem: Awakening), making <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pysanka' target='_blank'>pysanky</a>, making puns, and sharing weird animal facts.</p>
